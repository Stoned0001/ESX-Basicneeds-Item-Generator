Here you can get a good Extension for esx_basicneeds to make adding more food, more drinking and even more alcohol items if you use esx_optionalneeds, if you dont use optionalneeds then just delete the items with "drunk" from config

Example for usage:

beer = {Art= {"drunk", "hunger", "thirst"},menge = 20000, notification= 'Du hast dir ein frisch gezapftes Bier geg√∂nnt', prop_name = "lrz_tennets"};
